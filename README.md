I am a recent graduate with a strong passion for cybersecurity, currently working as a Data Analyst at Telus Digital. I am dedicated to solving complex problems through technology, and I am eager to transition into a cybersecurity role, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

## Objective
I am looking to apply my experience in data analysis, network security, and automation to a SOC role, where I can contribute to monitoring and defending enterprise networks against threats.
